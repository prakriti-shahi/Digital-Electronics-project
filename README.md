# Digital-Electronics-project

This project was done by Prakriti Shahi and Koya Sahiti Reddy in their Sophomore year at college under the supervision of Prof. Pradeep Sarin. The project consists of 2 verilog codes to be implemented on an FPGA (a field programable Gate Array).
One code demonstrates the physical phenomenon of jamming transition on the FPGA using rows of LEDs while the other creates a simple interactive 2-player tic-tac-toe game.
